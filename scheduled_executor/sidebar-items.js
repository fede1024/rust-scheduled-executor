The `CoreExecutor` will use a single thread for scheduling and execution, while the `ThreadPoolExecutor` will use a thread for scheduling, but multiple threads for the execution of the function. Internally, each executor uses a `tokio_core::reactor::Core` as event loop, that will drive the scheduling of the functions (and for the `CoreExecutor`, also their execution).
