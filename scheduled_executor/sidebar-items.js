initSidebarItems({"mod":[["executor","Executors allow easy scheduling and execution of functions or closures. The `CoreExecutor` uses a single thread for scheduling and execution, while the `ThreadPoolExecutor` uses multiple threads to execute the function. Internally, each executor uses a `tokio_core::reactor::Core` as event loop, that will drive the scheduling of the functions (and for the `CoreExecutor`, also their execution). A reference to the event loop is passed to every function when executed, allowing it to register additional events if needed."],["task_group","Task groups can be used whenever there is a sequence of tasks that need to be executed at regular intervals, and the sequence can change across different cycles."]]});
